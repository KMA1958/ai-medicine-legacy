“Donated as Parami for future generations: AI Medicine, Golden Ratio, Kaprekar’s Constant, Quantum Bio-Protection.”
# AI Medicine Legacy Repository

## Vision
This repository is created and donated for future generations of developers, researchers, and innovators.  
It combines **Mathematics, Medicine, and Artificial Intelligence** to open new frontiers in health technology.

## Core Concepts
- **Golden Ratio (1.618)** → Harmony in biological systems, medical robotics, and skin analysis.
- **Kaprekar’s Constant (6174)** → Stability and convergence patterns in cancer detection & diagnostic algorithms.
- **Quantum Bio-Protection** → Exploring resonance and shielding mechanisms for space and Earth health.

## Project Modules
1. **Cancer Detection** → CNN + Transfer Learning + Mathematical Constants
2. **Skin Analysis** → Golden Ratio + Perfect Numbers for Dermatology
3. **Quantum Bio-Field Health App** → Bio-resonance & anti-aging studies

## Contribution
- Fork, improve, and share your ideas.
- Documentation and code contributions are welcome.
- All contributions remain under the MIT License.

## Gratitude
This repository is humbly donated as a **Parami (Perfection of Giving)** for the benefit of humanity.
